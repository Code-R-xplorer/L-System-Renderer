# L-System Renderer
## Project Overview
This coursework was orginally developed for the Maths for Games and VR/AR module. It has since been improved during my personal time to fix a few issues with the original submission and add improvements that I didn't get a chance to do as apart of the submission.

I built this app using WPF as I wanted to learn about this language as I had never used it before and I thought I mights as well have a go learning it for this assignment. WPF was probably not the best to use for an application like this but it does the job fairly well.

## Iterations

As stated above there are two iterations of this project. The one you are currently are on is the latest version which I improved during my personal time after submitting it.

If you would like to view the version I submitted as apart of my coursework for the Maths module go [here](https://github.com/Code-R-xplorer/L-System-Renderer/tree/uni-build).

## Running the app

If you would just like to run the application follow these steps.

- Download the ZIP archive from the relase section
- Extract the files to where ever you want to store them
- Make sure the Presets folder is in the same folder as the .exe file
- Run the .exe and have fun!
